                        <span>
                            <strong>THE PURPOSE OF THE “LPMAX” (Liquidity Pool).</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Many
                            of us avid crypto currency investors may have been subjected to many types of unfortunate
                            events, such as, scams, rug pulls, honey pots, pump/dumps, etc.. that may have caused an
                            unfair loss. Therefore, being around a while and even experiencing a few of those terrible
                            circumstances, we concluded that we needed a solution and more “Developer Transparency &amp;
                            Accountability”.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>
                            <strong>So Our Team Created Dream Coin and The LPMAX (Liquidity
                                Pool)</strong></span><br /><br /><span>The most important elements that we decided were
                            necessary were investment safeguards. Therefore, it was imperative that we thought about
                            needed give assurance and insurance for investors by permitting it to have “maximum” buy
                            in/sell limits. In this case, 0.3BNB per transaction. We believe this assures a healthy
                            stable and steady growth of Dream Coin’s Token Value. Additionally, we also believe that it
                            was necessary to reward long term investors (holders) with 8% redistribution from all sells.
                            This made economical sense to us because it promotes growth and prospering benefits to
                            everyone. Lastly, to demonstrate a promising token value to holders of Dream Coin. We
                            implemented the BuyBack/AutoBurn of Dream Coin Tokens . Out of A Supply of 120 Million Dream
                            Coins Were Set To Burn A Maximum Up to 50% of Its Supply, Resulting In A Maximum of 60
                            Million Dream Coin. It is our hope to minimize market crashes, frustrate scamming techniques
                            and to help improve crypto investing “Hopes” To Make Everyone “Dreams Come True.”</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>
                            <strong>Why Static?</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Static rewards solve a host of
                            problems. First, the reward amount is conditional upon the volume of the token being traded.
                            This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token caused
                            by earlier adopters selling their tokens after farming crazy high APY’s. Second, the reflect
                            mechanism encourages holders to hang onto their tokens to garner higher kick-backs which are
                            based upon a percentages carried out and dependant upon the total tokens held by the
                            owner.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>
                            <strong>Auto buyback and Burn</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Dream coin implemented the
                            auto buyback and burn feature. This happens automatically when there is a selling. With
                            this, we were ensuring that our LPMAX was safe during buy/sells transactions.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>
                            <strong>Manual Burns</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Sometimes burns matter; sometimes they
                            don’t. A continuous burn on any one protocol can be nice in the early days, however, this
                            means the burn cannot be finite or controlled in any way. Having burns controlled by the
                            team and promoted based on achievements helps to keep the community rewarded and informed.
                            The conditions of the manual burn and the amounts can be advertised and tracked.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>Dream aims to implement a burn strategy that is beneficial and rewarding for those engaged
                            for the long term. Furthermore, the total number of Dream burned is featured on our readout
                            located on the website which allows for further transparency in identifying the current
                            circulating supply at any given point of time.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>
                            <strong>Automatic Liquidity Pool (LP)</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Automatic LP is the
                            secret sauce of Dream. Here we have a function that acts as a two-fold beneficial
                            implementation for holders.</span><br /><br /><span>First, the contract sucks up tokens from
                            sellers and buyers alike, and adds them to the LP creating a solid price floor.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>Second, the penalty acts as an arbitrage resistant mechanism that secures the volume of
                            Dream as a reward for the holders. In theory, the added LP creates a stability from the
                            supplied LP by adding the tax to the overall liquidity of the token, thus increasing the
                            tokens overall LP and supporting the price floor of the token. This is different from the
                            burn function of other reflection tokens which is only beneficial in the short term from the
                            granted reduction of supply.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>As the Dream token LP increases, the price stability mirrors this function with the
                            benefit of a solid price floor and cushion for holders. The goal here is to prevent the
                            larger dips when whales decide to sell their tokens later in the game, which keeps the price
                            from fluctuating as much as if there was no automatic LP function.</span>
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>All of this is an effort to alleviate some of the troubles we have seen with the current
                            DeFi reflection tokens. We are confident that this model and protocol will prevail over the
                            outdated reflection tokens for these reasons</span>

                                        DreamCoin is completely decentralized and all decisions are made by a community poll. Which gives our developers a better idea of how to move forward with DreamCoin. The DreamCoin developer team has no team tokens. In other words, our team has to participate in the DreamCoin presale along with other investors.
